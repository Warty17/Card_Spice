This Balatro mod aims to add many of the ideas I come up with that I think could spice up the gameplay (hence, Card SPICE).

This mod adds:
-15 original Jokers with custom made sprites;
-3 new Decks;
-A few card modifications and some Spectral Cards.

Generative AI was not at any point used in the making of the content's concept nor the art.

Way more ideas are in the making, but due to the limitations of Jayd-H's Joker-Forge (https://github.com/Jayd-H/joker-forge) I cannot implement them yet.
Substancial update is to be made once I figure out how to code in Lua.
